# Gerzensee_Exams
LaTex project to make a collection of solutions for the BDP in Gerzensee.

The [Swiss Program for Beginning Doctoral Students in Economics](https://szgerzensee.ch/courses/bdp) is a first year program for doctoral students.
The old exams are provided by the Study Center but solutions are missing.
That's why I thought it would be a good idea to start a collection of old solutions.

You can find hand written solutions for exams before 2022/23 on my [personal website](https://rodrigueztom.github.io/gerzensee/).
This repository serves to transform these solutions to latex.
This will make them more readable but it will also make it much easier to correct mistakes.

If you want to contribute, feel free to fork and do so.
I will review all pull requests that any of you make.
Especially welcome are solutions to exams that were published after 2022/23 since I never solved them.

If you contribute, feel free to add your credentials to the list of contributors.
